## Introduction

This is a project of mine I've been wanting to work on for a while: an automated
"bot" that will read papers for me and summarize them! I'm typically bad with
keeping up with reading, and now that my interests have significantly diversified
(chemistry, astronomy, machine learning) it makes it that much harder to stay
on top of things I should be reading.

Enter `arxiv-curie`: an open-source project that is designed to be lightweight
enough to run on a Raspberry Pi 2 during the night, and serves paper summaries
to you in the morning. 

## Milestones

- [ ] CLI to download a paper from arXiv, and produce a set-length summary.
- [ ] Screen latest arXiv releases, and _recommend_ based on provided examples.
- [ ] Automatically explore older entries, and recommend them.
- [ ] Intelligently recommend related papers, based on citation networks.
- [ ] Dash front-end.
- [ ] Timed pulling, summarizing, and emailing to your inbox.
- [ ] Slack integration(?) I have no experience in this!
